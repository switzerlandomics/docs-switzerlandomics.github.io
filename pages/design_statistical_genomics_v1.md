**Protocol name**: `design_statistical_genomics_v1`

Statistical genomics to find new cohort-level associations with disease.
This documention is an incomplete placeholder.
This protocol is made up of several steps which together make the joint analysis.
Pages on individual methods include [VSAT](vsat.html), [setID](vsat_setID.html), [ACAT](acat.html), [GWAS](gwas.html).

This set of analysis use `Design DNA SNV INDEL v1` followed by `QV SNV INDEL v1` as input.
The following aims are then used to reach the joint analysis.
