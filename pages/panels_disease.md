# Panels disease gene

Last update: 20241205

The main source of our panel data is from Genomics England panelapp
<https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk>.
The PanelApp database includes all the gene panels that relate to genomic tests listed in the [NHS National Genomic Test Directory](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/national-genomic-test-directories), as well as the virtual gene panels that were used in the [100,000 Genomes Project](https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/initiatives/100000-genomes-project).

We explicitly aim to develop methods that avoid the bias of virtual panel analysis. 
However, the knowledge of known disease-gene mechanisms are a valuable scoring feature in variant classification.

For example, ACMG variant classification standards include eight stages which use knowledge of genes with a known mechanism of disease.
These apply when classifying evidence related to both pathogenic or benign effects.
The affected ACGM criteria are:
PVS1, PS1, PM1, PP1,
BVS1, BS1, BM1, BP1.
A subsequent example is the ACMG classification step, PVS1, which is defined as a "null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical +- 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multiexon deletion) in a gene where LOF is a known mechanism of disease".
Thus to define a gene as belonging to a known disease mechanism we must use a stable and reliable source of disease-genes.
