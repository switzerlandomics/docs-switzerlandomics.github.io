## Inborn errors of metabolism

### Invitae panels
* **Usage**: Not in use.
* While these a good gene lists, they do not include inheritance pattern information (i.e. autosomal dominant/recessive) which is required for more accurate ACMGuru classifications:
	- Methylmalonic Acidemia and Homocystinuria (GTR000553763.2)
		- <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/tests/553763/>
	- Cobalamin/Propionate/Homocysteine Metabolism Related Disorders (GTR000519388.10)

### Genomics England panels
* **Usage**: currently imported as `metabol` in ACMGuru.
* Likely inborn error of metabolism - targeted testing not possible (Version 5.24)
	- <https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/panels/467/>
	- This gene panel from Genomics England contains inheritance pattern information (i.e. autosomal dominant/recessive).
