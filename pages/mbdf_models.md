# Multiblock Data Fusion Options

This document outlines three levels of data fusion methods:

## High-level data fusion

- **Approach**: integration of outcomes from individual models.
- **Key features**:
  - treat each data block separately
  - combine summary statistics or predictions
  - utilise ensemble learning or voting schemes
- **Use case**: when joint interpretation of biomarker patterns or decision fusion is desired

## Mid-level data fusion

- **Approach**: extract and integrate features from each data block.
- **Key features**:
  - dimensionality reduction methods (e.g. PCA, PLS) to obtain scores
  - two-step procedure:
    - *middle-up*: reduce dimensions then concatenate scores
    - *middle-down*: select key variables then concatenate subsets
- **Use case**: when intermediate patterns or characteristics are needed for further analysis

## Low-level data fusion

- **Approach**: direct integration of raw signals or data.
- **Key features**:
  - analyse relationships across data blocks
  - factor analysis or multiblock modelling to create components
  - optimise for both within-block representation and between-block correlation
- **Use case**: when it is necessary to capture detailed inter-variable and inter-block relationships

# Final notes

## Matrix factorisation

Below is an example of how individual contributions from each data block can combine into a global factor for three factors \(F_1\), \(F_2\), and \(F_3\):

$$
F_1 = X_1^1 w_1^1 + X_2^1 w_2^1 + \dots + X_n^1 w_n^1
$$

$$
F_2 = X_1^2 w_1^2 + X_2^2 w_2^2 + \dots + X_n^2 w_n^2
$$

$$
F_3 = X_1^3 w_1^3 + X_2^3 w_2^3 + \dots + X_n^3 w_n^3
$$

The objective is often to maximise the overall covariance across blocks:

$$
\max \sum_{j,k} \operatorname{cov}\bigl(X_j^m w_j^m,\; X_k^m w_k^m\bigr)
$$

## Correlation, variance and covariance

Correlation quantifies the relationship between two variables. This principle is extended to assess links between entire data blocks:

$$
\operatorname{corr}(x,y) 
= \frac{\operatorname{cov}(x,y)}{\sqrt{\operatorname{var}(x)\,\operatorname{var}(y)}}
$$

## Extracting structures from data

Data components are linear combinations of original variables. Their relationships can be compared using:

$$
\operatorname{cov}^2\bigl(X_j w_j,\; X_k w_k\bigr) 
= \operatorname{var}(X_j w_j)\,\operatorname{corr}^2\bigl(X_j w_j,\; X_k w_k\bigr)\,\operatorname{var}(X_k w_k)
$$

The RV coefficient is an alternative that compares sample configurations across matrices, even when variable counts differ.

Methods like partial least squares (PLS) determine the first latent variables \(t_1\) and \(u_1\) for two data blocks by maximising their covariance.

## Low-level horizontal multiblock analysis

This approach integrates multiple data blocks sharing the same observations. It can be considered at two levels:

- **block level (local)**:
  $$
  w'X_1,\quad w'X_2,\quad w'X_3
  $$

- **super level (global)**:
  global scores combine the individual block contributions, for example:
  $$
  tX_s,\quad w^T,\quad qX,\quad uY,\quad Y
  $$

The super level is constructed based on the chosen model and aims to capture overall patterns.

## Methods and criteria to be optimised

Many methods require choosing which variation to prioritise. In practice, covariance is used as a criterion to balance within-block detail and between-block connections.

## Potential model outputs

- new common subspace: shared latent components revealing global patterns
- common/distinct components: factors separating shared structure from block-specific variation
- pattern recognition: improved detection of meaningful relationships across variables
- global/local observation scores: individual sample scores facilitating both overall and block-level interpretations
- variables loadings: insights into which variables contribute most strongly to each component
- block weights: balancing each blockâ€™s influence on the global model
- more complete interpretation: linking variables within each block and across multiple blocks
