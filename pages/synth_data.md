This script will show you how to make synthetic (fake example) data. The data should match what you expect to see in a real dataset.
The provided script demonstrates a practical approach for creating and utilising synthetic datasets in R, aimed at continuing data analysis development when access to original data is restricted due to legal or privacy concerns. This method allows developers and analysts to develop and test analytical models and data processing pipelines without compromising data governance policies.

## Key Components of the Script:
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `dplyr` for data manipulation.
  - `ggplot2` for data visualisation.
  - `synthpop` for synthesising datasets, ensuring the synthetic versions maintain similar statistical distributions as the originals.
  - `patchwork` for combining plots into a single image for easier analysis.
- **Datasets:**
  - The script utilises well-known R datasets, `mtcars` and `iris`, which exemplify numeric and categorical data types, respectively.
- **Synthesising Data:**
  - The `syn()` function generates synthetic datasets, with subsequent verification steps to ensure these datasets match the original data in terms of structure and type.
- **Adding Sample Names:**
  - Using `sprintf()` to generate formatted sample names provides unique identifiers that aid in managing and referencing samples during analyses.
- **Data Visualisation and Comparison:**
  - Various plotting functions are crafted to compare the distributions between original and synthetic datasets through density plots, bar plots, and linear regression analyses, adapting the visualisation method based on the dataâ€™s characteristics (numeric vs. categorical).
- **Saving Visual Outputs:**
  - The `ggsave()` function is utilised to save generated plots to files, enabling easy distribution and review.

## Purpose and Benefits:
- **Development Continuity:** This approach supports the continuous development of data analysis tools in scenarios where actual data cannot be used.
- **Model Testing:** It facilitates preliminary testing of statistical models, ensuring they will perform as expected with real-world data.
- **Privacy Compliance:** By using synthetic data, the method adheres to data privacy laws, ensuring that personal or sensitive information is not disclosed.

This technique is especially valuable in sectors such as healthcare or finance, where data sensitivity is critical. It provides a viable solution to data access limitations while ensuring compliance and development efficiency.


## Code example

### 1. Example with numeric dataset (mtcars)

<img src="{{ "assets/images/patch1.png" | relative_url }}" width="80%">

**Figure 1**: Comparison of numeric data distributions for MPG, HP, and WT between original and synthetic data from the `mtcars` dataset. Each panel shows a density plot for one variable.

<img src="{{ "assets/images/patch2.png" | relative_url }}" width="80%">

**Figure 2**: Linear regression comparisons between MPG vs HP and WT vs MPG for original and synthetic `mtcars` data. Each plot includes a point scatter overlaid with a linear regression line.


```R
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(synthpop)
library(patchwork)

# 1. example with mtcars numeric dataset  ----

# Load mtcars dataset
data("mtcars")
df <- mtcars

# Check dimensions of the data: rows and columns
dim(df)

# Check column types
sapply(df, class)

# Create a synthetic version of the dataset
syn_df <- syn(df, seed = 1234)

# Generate synthetic data maintaining the distribution, mean, etc.
synthetic_data <- syn_df$syn

# Print dimensions to confirm they match original data
dim(synthetic_data)

# Generate sample names using sprintf to ensure proper zero padding
synthetic_data$Sample_Names <- sprintf("AAA_%03d", seq_len(nrow(synthetic_data)))

# Function to compare distributions between original and synthetic datasets
compare_plot <- function(original, synthetic, col_name) {
	original_df <- data.frame(Value = original[[col_name]], Type = "Original")
