# My voice

**My voice** is an optional note you can add when you request your genomic data. It gives you a place to record what matters to you in plain words. You might write why you are interested in your genome, what you hope to learn, details of health or family history, or simply how you would like information explained in the future.  

Your note may or may not change the scientific analysis; it depends on your preference. It is stored securely with your request and kept as part of your history, so it can be referred to later if needed. Each new request lets you add a fresh note or reuse what you wrote before.  

Recording your voice ensures that your perspective stays linked with your data. It provides a clear record of your intentions and context, whether your interest is health, ancestry, or long-term storage.  

## Here are examples
