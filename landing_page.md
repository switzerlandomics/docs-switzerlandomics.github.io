## Mission

**To translate well-established omics research methods into the clinic.**

---

With our research partners in leading universities, we have the opportunity to implement world-class omics methods in the clinic.

Multiple branches of health-related bioinformatics and state-of-the-art technologies are being combined with existing clinical best-practice to advance the potential for precision medicine.
To achieve these tasks we must design and build the infrastructure for dealing with large-scale data processing in a protected environment.
We must also translate complex outputs into actionable reports with clear recommendations based on traceable evidence and recognised clinical practice guidelines.
